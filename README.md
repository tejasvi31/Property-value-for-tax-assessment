# Property-value-for-tax-assessment

We have data of properties collected by a Municipal Council for the purpose of computation of assessed value and assessment of property tax within the framework of state 
laws. An individual tax lot may range from multiple buildings to just one residential or commercial unit in a condominium.

Assessed value depends on the variables such as location, building class for understanding constructive use, area (land and/or buildup), year of construction etc. Location can be 
measured by certain data elements like ZIP code, longitudinal, latitudinal measures etc.
 
The Municipal council is facing the problem of many citizens challenging the assessment of property taxes and is criticized for complicated assessment procedure system as well as 
multiple required filings throughout the year to challenge oneâ€™s assessment. Therefore, the Council wants to rationalise the tax assessment system. They also want to structure benefit programs based on certain variables of statistical significance to incentivise additional construction activity or activity of conversion/modification of properties for reducing tax burden and/or to make the contemplated projects more economically feasible.

Therefore the idea is to achieve consistent, rational and objective assessment of properties based on a predictive model by automating the property valuation process to reduce the unfairness within the tax system.

Here, we predict the property evaluation value based on the quantitative and qualitative features provided in the dataset.
